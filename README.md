1. $color = array('white', 'green', 'red', 'blue', 'black');
Write a script which will display the following string -
"The memory of that scene for me is like a frame of film forever frozen at that moment: the red carpet, the green lawn, the white house, the leaden sky. The new president and his first lady. - Richard M. Nixon"
and the words 'red', 'green' and 'white' will come from $color.

2. Write a PHP function to change the following array's all values to upper or lower case.
Sample arrays :
$Color = array('A' => 'Blue', 'B' => 'Green', 'c' => 'Red');
Expected Output :
Values are in lower case.
Array ( [A] => blue [B] => green [c] => red ) 
Values are in upper case.
Array ( [A] => BLUE [B] => GREEN [c] => RED )

3. Write a PHP script to generate unique random numbers within a range.
     Sample Range : (11, 20)

4. Write a PHP script to lower-case and upper-case, all elements in an array.

5. If you have an array $a = array( 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ); how do you extract the value "3" from the array? 

6. If you have an array $a = array( "zero"=>0, "one"=>1, "two"=>2, "three"=>3, "four"=>4 );, how do you extract the value 3 from the array?

7. You have two arrays like the following. One contains field labels, the other contains field values. Write a program to output the third array.
$keys = array(
    "field1"=>"first",
    "field2"=>"second",
    "field3"=>"third"
);
$values = array(
    "field1value"=>"dinosaur",
    "field2value"=>"pig",
    "field3value"=>"platypus"
);
// want to output
$keysAndValues = array(
    "first"=>"dinosaur",
    "second"=>"pig",
    "third"=>"platypus"
);

8. You have an array of transactions, each of which has a debit and credit amount. Find the absolute value of the transaction amount (i.e. abs( debit - credit ))  and add it as a new key=>value pair to each transaction.
$transactions = array(
    array(
        "debit"=>2,
        "credit"=>3
    ),
    array(
        "debit"=>15,
        "credit"=>14
    )
);
// outputs
$transactions = array(
    array(
        "debit"=>2,
        "credit"=>3,
        "amount"=>1
    ),
    array(
        "debit"=>15,
        "credit"=>14,
        "amount"=>1
    )
);

9. Find the sum of this array of numbers $a = array( 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 );

10. Create a script that displays 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9---100 on one line. There will be no hyphen(-) at starting and ending position.

11. Create a script using a for loop to add all the integers between 0 and 100 and display the total.

12. Create a script to construct the following pattern, using nested for loop.
*  
* *  
* * *  
* * * *  
* * * * *   

13. Create a script to construct the following pattern, using a nested for loop.
* 
* * 
* * * 
* * * * 
* * * * * 
* * * * * 
* * * * 
* * *

14. Write a program to calculate and print the factorial of a number using a for loop. The factorial of a number is the product of all integers up to and including that number, so the factorial of 5 is 5*4*3*2*1= 120. 

15. Write a program which will count the "e" characters in the text "w3resource". 

 
 

17. Write a PHP program which iterates the integers from 1 to 50. For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz". 

18. Write a PHP program to print alphabet pattern 'H'.
Expected Output:

 *   		*                                                      
 *   		*                                                      
 *   		*                                                      
 ***********
